                                <h3>FullStack Web Developer, born and raised in Austin Texas</h3>
                                <p>I take the design and functionality of the web very seriously, not only as a developer but as a daily user of it as well. 
                                The internet is one of the most powerful tools on the face of the earth, allowing millions of people access to information, 
                                applications, and tools to make them more productive. Nothing hinders people more in their quest than that of poorly designed 
                                sites which do not function as expected.</p>

                                <h3>Functionality</h3>
                                <p>Every day I learn a little bit more about Javascript. See new ways people are using it. Thinking about ways I would like to 
                                see web pages work. I take working prototypes to my friends and let them play around with my apps, watching to see how they 
                                use my apps, and when my app fails to give them the result they desired. Its these lessons that constantly rethinking my 
                                interfaces, and polishing them for the best experience for the user, going beyond what made sense to me as the developer.
                                </p>

                                    <p>Rebuilding DiceBag utilizing React to become more familiar with the technology. Currently this project is in the
                                    design phase. I'm reimagining how I want to handle each 'dice' and allow users to create macros that roll several dice 
                                    at a time instead of only a single dice.</p>
